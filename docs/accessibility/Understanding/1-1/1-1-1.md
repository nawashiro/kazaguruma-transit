## Understanding: Non-text Content (Level A)

## In Brief

Goal

Non-text information is available to more people.

What to do

Create a text alternative for visual and auditory content.

Why it's important

People who can’t fully see or hear content can understand it.

## Success Criterion (SC)

All [non-text content](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/#dfn-non-text-content) that is presented to the user has a [text alternative](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/#dfn-text-alternative) that serves the equivalent purpose, except for the situations listed below.

Controls, Input

If non-text content is a control or accepts user input, then it has a [name](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/#dfn-name) that describes its purpose. (Refer to [Success Criterion 4.1.2](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#name-role-value) for additional requirements for controls and content that accepts user input.)

Time-Based Media

If non-text content is time-based media, then text alternatives at least provide descriptive identification of the non-text content. (Refer to [Guideline 1.2](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#time-based-media) for additional requirements for media.)

Test

If non-text content is a test or exercise that would be invalid if presented in [text](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/#dfn-text), then text alternatives at least provide descriptive identification of the non-text content.

Sensory

If non-text content is primarily intended to create a [specific sensory experience](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/#dfn-specific-sensory-experience), then text alternatives at least provide descriptive identification of the non-text content.

[CAPTCHA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/#dfn-captcha)

If the purpose of non-text content is to confirm that content is being accessed by a person rather than a computer, then text alternatives that identify and describe the purpose of the non-text content are provided, and alternative forms of CAPTCHA using output modes for different types of sensory perception are provided to accommodate different disabilities.

Decoration, Formatting, Invisible

If non-text content is [pure decoration](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/#dfn-pure-decoration), is used only for visual formatting, or is not presented to users, then it is implemented in a way that it can be ignored by [assistive technology](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/#dfn-assistive-technology).

## Intent

The intent of this success criterion is to make information conveyed by non-text content accessible through the use of a text alternative. Text alternatives are a primary way for making information accessible because they can be rendered through any sensory modality (for example, visual, auditory or tactile) to match the needs of the user. Providing text alternatives allows the information to be rendered in a variety of ways by a variety of user agents. For example, people who cannot see a picture can have the text alternative read aloud using synthesized speech. People who cannot hear an audio file can have the text alternative displayed so that they can read it. In the future, text alternatives will also allow information to be more easily translated into sign language or into a simpler form of the same language.

### Note on alternatives matching the language of content

Text alternatives and equivalents should match the human language of the original content (normally the default human language of the page). The [5.2 Conformance Requirements](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#conformance-reqs) section, through the defined terms used there, states that success criteria be met through accessibility-supported ways (5.2.4), where the technology is used “in the human language of the content.” Where an alternative version is used (5.2.1), it is defined as something that “provides all of the same information and functionality in the same human language.”

### Additional information

Non-text content can take a number of forms, and this success criterion specifies how each is to be handled.

**For non-text content that is not covered by one of the other situations listed below,** such as charts, diagrams, audio recordings, pictures, and animations, text alternatives can make the same information available in a form that can be rendered through any modality (for example, visual, auditory or tactile). Short and long text alternatives can be used as needed to convey the information in the non-text content. Note that **prerecorded audio-only** and **prerecorded video-only** files are covered here. **Live-audio-only** and **Live-video-only** files are covered below (see 3rd paragraph following this one).

**For non-text content that is a control or accepts user input** , such as images used as submit buttons, image maps or complex animations, a name is provided to describe the purpose of the non-text content so that the person at least knows what the non-text content is and why it is there.

**Non-text content that is time-based media** is made accessible through [1.2: Time-Based Media](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/time-based-media). However, it is important that users know what it is when they encounter it on a page so they can decide what action if any they want to take with it. A text alternative that describes the time-based media and/or gives its title is therefore provided.

**For Live Audio-only and live video-only content** , it can be much more difficult to provide text alternatives that provide equivalent information as live audio-only and live video-only content. For these types of non-text content, text alternatives provide a descriptive label.

**Sometimes a test or exercise must be partially or completely presented in non-text format.** Audio or visual information is provided that cannot be changed to text because the test or exercise must be conducted using that sense. For example, a hearing test would be invalid if a text alternative were provided. A visual skill development exercise would similarly make no sense in text form. And a spelling test with text alternatives would not be very effective. For these cases, text alternatives should be provided to describe the purpose of the non-text content; of course, the text alternatives would not provide the same information needed to pass the test.

**Sometimes content is primarily intended to create a specific sensory experience** that words cannot fully capture. Examples include a symphony performance, works of visual art etc. For such content, text alternatives at least identify the non-text content with a descriptive label and where possible, additional descriptive text. If the reason for including the content in the page is known and can be described it is helpful to include that information.

**Sometimes there are non-text exercises that are used to prove you are human.** To avoid spam robots and other software from gaining access to a site a device called a CAPTCHA is used. These usually involve visual or auditory tasks that are beyond the current capabilities of web robots. Providing a text alternative to them would however make them operable by Robots, thus defeating their purpose. In this case a text alternative would describe the purpose of the CAPTCHA, and alternate forms using different modalities would be provided to address the needs of people with different disabilities.

**Sometimes there is non-text content that really is not meant to be seen or understood by the user.** Transparent images used to move text over on a page; an invisible image that is used to track usage statistics; and a swirl in the corner that conveys no information but just fills up a blank space to create an aesthetic effect are all examples of this. Putting alternative text on such items just distracts people using screen readers from the content on the page. Not marking the content in any way, though, leaves users guessing what the non-text content is and what information they may have missed (even though they have not missed anything in reality). This type of non-text content, therefore, is marked or implemented in a way that assistive technologies (AT) will ignore it and not present anything to the user.

## Benefits

- This success criterion helps people who have difficulty perceiving visual content. Assistive technology can read text aloud, present it visually, or convert it to braille.
- Text alternatives may help some people who have difficulty understanding the meaning of photographs, drawings, and other images (e.g., line drawings, graphic designs, paintings, three-dimensional representations), graphs, charts, animations, etc.
- People who are deaf, are hard of hearing, or who are having trouble understanding audio information for any reason can read the text presentation. Research is ongoing regarding automatic translation of text into sign language.
- People who are deaf-blind can read the text in braille.
- Additionally, text alternatives support the ability to search for non-text content and to repurpose content in a variety of ways.

## Examples

A data chart

A bar chart compares how many widgets were sold in June, July, and August. The short label says, "Figure one - Sales in June, July and August." The longer description identifies the type of chart, provides a high-level summary of the data, trends and implications comparable to those available from the chart. Where possible and practical, the actual data is provided in a table.

An audio recording of a speech

The link to an audio clip says, "Chairman's speech to the assembly." A link to a text transcript is provided immediately after the link to the audio clip.

An animation that illustrates how a car engine works

An animation shows how a car engine works. There is no audio and the animation is part of a tutorial that describes how an engine works. Since the text of the tutorial already provides a full explanation, the image is an alternative for text and the text alternative includes only a brief description of the animation and refers to the tutorial text for more information.

A traffic web camera

A website allows users to select from a variety of web cameras positioned throughout a major city. After a camera is selected, the image updates every two minutes. A short text alternative identifies the web camera as "traffic web camera." The site also provides a table of travel times for each of the routes covered by the web cameras. The table is also updated every two minutes.

A photograph of an historic event in a news story

A photograph of two world leaders shaking hands accompanies a news story about an international summit meeting. The text alternative says, "President X of Country X shakes hands with Prime Minister Y of country Y."

A photograph of a historic event in content discussing diplomatic relationships

The same image is used in a different context intended to explain nuances in diplomatic encounters. The image of the president shaking hands with the prime minister appears on a website discussing intricate diplomatic relationships. The first text alternative reads, "President X of country X shakes hands with Prime Minister Y of country Y on January 2, 2009." An additional text alternative describes the room where the leaders are standing as well as the expressions on the leaders' faces, and identifies the other people in the room. The additional description might be included on the same page as the photograph or in a separate file associated with the image through a link or other standard programmatic mechanism.

An audio recording of a press conference

A web page includes a link to an audio recording of a press conference. The link text identifies the audio recording. The page also links to a text transcript of the press conference. The transcript includes a verbatim record of everything the speakers say. It identifies who is speaking as well as noting other significant sounds that are part of the recording, such as applause, laughter, questions from the audience, and so on.

An e-learning application

An e-learning application uses sound effects to indicate whether or not the answers are correct. The chime sound indicates that the answer is correct and the beep sound indicates that the answer is incorrect. A text description is also included so that people who can't hear or understand the sound understand whether the answer is correct or incorrect.

A linked thumbnail image

A thumbnail image of the front page of a newspaper links to the home page of the "Smallville Times". The text alternative says "Smallville Times".

The same image used on different sites

Different alternatives for an image of the world: An image of the world that is used on a travel site as a link to the International Travel section has the text alternative "International Travel". The same image is used as a link on a university website with the text alternative "International Campuses".

An image map

An image of a building floor plan is interactive, allowing the user to select a particular room and navigate to a page containing information about that room. The short text alternative describes the image and its interactive purpose: "Building floor plan. Select a room for more information."

## Key Terms

ASCII art

picture created by a spatial arrangement of characters or glyphs (typically from the 95 printable characters defined by ASCII)

assistive technology

hardware and/or software that acts as a [user agent](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/#dfn-user-agent), or along with a mainstream user agent, to provide functionality to meet the requirements of users with disabilities that go beyond those offered by mainstream user agents

Note 1

Functionality provided by assistive technology includes alternative presentations (e.g., as synthesized speech or magnified content), alternative input methods (e.g., voice), additional navigation or orientation mechanisms, and content transformations (e.g., to make tables more accessible).

Note 2

Assistive technologies often communicate data and messages with mainstream user agents by using and monitoring APIs.

Note 3

The distinction between mainstream user agents and assistive technologies is not absolute. Many mainstream user agents provide some features to assist individuals with disabilities. The basic difference is that mainstream user agents target broad and diverse audiences that usually include people with and without disabilities. Assistive technologies target narrowly defined populations of users with specific disabilities. The assistance provided by an assistive technology is more specific and appropriate to the needs of its target users. The mainstream user agent may provide important functionality to assistive technologies like retrieving web content from program objects or parsing markup into identifiable bundles.

initialism for "Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart"

Note 1

CAPTCHA tests often involve asking the user to type in text that is displayed in an obscured image or audio file.

Note 2

A Turing test is any system of tests designed to differentiate a human from a computer. It is named after famed computer scientist Alan Turing. The term was coined by researchers at Carnegie Mellon University.

Note 2

The term label is not limited to the label element in HTML.

name

text by which software can identify a component within web content to the user

Note 1

The name may be hidden and only exposed by assistive technology, whereas a [label](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/#dfn-label) is presented to all users. In many (but not all) cases, the label and the name are the same.

non-text content
