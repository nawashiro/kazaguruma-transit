## Understanding: Audio Control (Level A)

## In Brief

Goal

A page that plays music or sounds doesn't disrupt people.

What to do

If you play audio content automatically, let people turn it down or off.

Why it's important

Sound distracts some people, and also interferes with screen readers.

## Success Criterion (SC)

If any audio on a web page plays automatically for more than 3 seconds, either a [mechanism](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/#dfn-mechanism) is available to [pause](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/#dfn-paused) or stop the audio, or a mechanism is available to control audio volume independently from the overall system volume level.

Note

Since any content that does not meet this success criterion can interfere with a user's ability to use the whole page, all content on the web page (whether or not it is used to meet other success criteria) must meet this success criterion. See [Conformance Requirement 5: Non-Interference](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#cc5).

## Intent

Individuals who use screen reading software can find it hard to hear the speech output if there is other audio playing at the same time. This difficulty is exacerbated when the screen reader's speech output is software based (as most are today) and is controlled via the same volume control as the sound. Therefore, it is important that the user be able to turn off the background sound.

Having control of the volume includes being able to reduce its volume to zero. Muting the system volume is not "pausing or stopping" the autoplay audio. Both the "pause or stop" and control of audio volume need to be independent of the overall system volume.

Note

Playing audio automatically when landing on a page may affect a screen reader user's ability to find the mechanism to stop it because they navigate by listening and automatically started sounds might interfere with that navigation. Therefore, we discourage the practice of automatically starting sounds (especially if they last more than 3 seconds), and encourage that the sound be _started_ by an action initiated by the user after they reach the page, rather than requiring that the sound be _stopped_ by an action of the user after they land on the page.

See also [1.4.7 Low or No Background Audio](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/low-or-no-background-audio).

In the context of this Success Criterion, "plays automatically" broadly refers to audio that is not started/played as a direct result of a user's intentional activation. For example, not selecting a link or button.

## Benefits

- Individuals who use screen reading technologies can hear the screen reader without other sounds playing. This is especially important for those who are hard of hearing and for those whose screen readers use the system volume (so they cannot turn sound down and screen reader up).
- This success criterion also benefits people who have difficulty focusing on visual content (including text) when audio is playing.

## Examples

- An audio file begins playing automatically when a page is opened. However, the audio can be stopped by the user by selecting a "silent" link at the top of the page.

## Techniques

Each numbered item in this section represents a technique or combination of techniques that the WCAG Working Group deems sufficient for meeting this Success Criterion. A technique may go beyond the minimum requirement of the criterion. There may be other ways of meeting the criterion not covered by these techniques. For information on using other techniques, see [Understanding Techniques for WCAG Success Criteria](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/understanding-techniques), particularly the "Other Techniques" section.

### Sufficient Techniques

- [G60: Playing a sound that turns off automatically within three seconds](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Techniques/general/G60)
- [G170: Providing a control near the beginning of the web page that turns off sounds that play automatically](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Techniques/general/G170)
- [G171: Playing sounds only on user request](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Techniques/general/G171)

### Failures

The following are common mistakes that are considered failures of this Success Criterion by the WCAG Working Group.

- [F23: Failure of 1.4.2 due to playing a sound longer than 3 seconds where there is no mechanism to turn it off](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Techniques/failures/F23)
- [F93: Failure of Success Criterion 1.4.2 for absence of a way to pause or stop an HTML5 media element that autoplays](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Techniques/failures/F93)

## Key Terms

assistive technology

hardware and/or software that acts as a [user agent](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/#dfn-user-agent), or along with a mainstream user agent, to provide functionality to meet the requirements of users with disabilities that go beyond those offered by mainstream user agents

Note 1

Functionality provided by assistive technology includes alternative presentations (e.g., as synthesized speech or magnified content), alternative input methods (e.g., voice), additional navigation or orientation mechanisms, and content transformations (e.g., to make tables more accessible).

Note 2

Assistive technologies often communicate data and messages with mainstream user agents by using and monitoring APIs.

Note 3

The distinction between mainstream user agents and assistive technologies is not absolute. Many mainstream user agents provide some features to assist individuals with disabilities. The basic difference is that mainstream user agents target broad and diverse audiences that usually include people with and without disabilities. Assistive technologies target narrowly defined populations of users with specific disabilities. The assistance provided by an assistive technology is more specific and appropriate to the needs of its target users. The mainstream user agent may provide important functionality to assistive technologies like retrieving web content from program objects or parsing markup into identifiable bundles.

conformance

satisfying all the requirements of a given standard, guideline or specification

mechanism

[process](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/#dfn-process) or technique for achieving a result

Note 1

The mechanism may be explicitly provided in the content, or may be [relied upon](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/#dfn-relied-upon) to be provided by either the platform or by [user agents](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/#dfn-user-agent), including [assistive technologies](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/#dfn-assistive-technology).

Note 2

The mechanism needs to meet all success criteria for the conformance level claimed.

paused

stopped by user request and not resumed until requested by user

process

series of user actions where each action is required in order to complete an activity

relied upon

the content would not [conform](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/#dfn-conformance) if that [technology](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/#dfn-technology) is turned off or is not supported

technology

[mechanism](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/#dfn-mechanism) for encoding instructions to be rendered, played or executed by [user agents](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/#dfn-user-agent)

Note 1

As used in these guidelines "web technology" and the word "technology" (when used alone) both refer to web content technologies.

Note 2

Web content technologies may include markup languages, data formats, or programming languages that authors may use alone or in combination to create end-user experiences that range from static web pages to synchronized media presentations to dynamic Web applications.

user agent

any software that retrieves and presents web content for users

## Test Rules

The following are Test Rules for certain aspects of this Success Criterion. It is not necessary to use these particular Test Rules to check for conformance with WCAG, but they are defined and approved test methods. For information on using Test Rules, see [Understanding Test Rules for WCAG Success Criteria](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/understanding-act-rules.html).

- [Audio or video element avoids automatically playing audio](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/act/rules/80f0bf/proposed/)
