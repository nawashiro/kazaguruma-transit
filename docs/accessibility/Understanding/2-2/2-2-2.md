## Understanding: Pause, Stop, Hide (Level A)

## In Brief

Goal

Fewer users are distracted by content that updates or moves.

What to do

Let users control content changes that occur in parallel with other content.

Why it's important

Some people with cognitive disabilities and attention deficits are distracted by continuous movement.

## Success Criterion (SC)

For moving, [blinking](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/#dfn-blinking), scrolling, or auto-updating information, all of the following are true:

Moving, blinking, scrolling

For any moving, blinking or scrolling information that (1) starts automatically, (2) lasts more than five seconds, and (3) is presented in parallel with other content, there is a [mechanism](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/#dfn-mechanism) for the user to [pause](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/#dfn-paused), stop, or hide it unless the movement, blinking, or scrolling is part of an activity where it is [essential](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/#dfn-essential); and

Auto-updating

For any auto-updating information that (1) starts automatically and (2) is presented in parallel with other content, there is a mechanism for the user to pause, stop, or hide it or to control the frequency of the update unless the auto-updating is part of an activity where it is essential.

Note 2

Since any content that does not meet this success criterion can interfere with a user's ability to use the whole page, all content on the web page (whether it is used to meet other success criteria or not) must meet this success criterion. See [Conformance Requirement 5: Non-Interference](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#cc5).

Note 3

Content that is updated periodically by software or that is streamed to the user agent is not required to preserve or present information that is generated or received between the initiation of the pause and resuming presentation, as this may not be technically possible, and in many situations could be misleading to do so.

Note 4

An animation that occurs as part of a preload phase or similar situation can be considered essential if interaction cannot occur during that phase for all users and if not indicating progress could confuse users or cause them to think that content was frozen or broken.

## Intent

The intent of this success criterion is to avoid distracting users during their interaction with a web page.

In the context of this Success Criterion, "starts automatically" broadly refers to animations/updates that are not the direct result of a user's intentional activation, for example, selecting a link or button.

"Moving, blinking and scrolling" refers to content in which the visible content conveys a sense of motion. Common examples include motion pictures, synchronized media presentations, animations, real-time games, and scrolling stock tickers. "Auto-updating" refers to content that updates or disappears based on a preset time interval. Common time-based content includes automatically updated weather information, news, stock price updates, and auto-advancing presentations and messages. The requirements for moving, blinking and scrolling content and for auto-updating content are the same except that:

- authors have the option of providing the user with a means to control the frequency of updates when content is auto-updating and
- there is no five second exception for auto-updating since it makes little sense to auto-update for a few seconds and then stop

Content that moves or auto-updates can be a barrier to anyone who has trouble reading stationary text quickly as well as anyone who has trouble tracking moving objects. It can also cause problems for screen readers.

Moving content can also be a severe distraction for some people. Certain groups, particularly those with attention deficit disorders, find blinking content distracting, making it difficult for them to concentrate on other parts of the web page. Five seconds was chosen because it is long enough to get a user's attention, but not so long that a user cannot wait out the distraction if necessary to use the page.

Content that is paused can either resume in real-time or continue playing from the point in the presentation where the user left off.

- Pausing and resuming where the user left off is best for users who want to pause to read content and works best when the content is not associated with a real-time event or status.
- Pausing and jumping to current display (when pause is released) is better for information that is real-time or "status" in nature. For example, weather radar, a stock ticker, a traffic camera, or an auction timer, would present misleading information if a pause caused it to display old information when the content was restarted.
  Note
  Hiding content would have the same result as pausing and jumping to current display (when pause is released).

For a mechanism to be considered "a mechanism for the user to pause," it must provide the user with a means to pause that does not tie up the user or the focus so that the page cannot be used. The word "pause" here is meant in the sense of a "pause button" although other mechanisms than a button can be used. Having an animation stop only so long as a user has focus on it (where it restarts as soon as the user moves the focus away) would not be considered a "mechanism for the user to pause" because it makes the page unusable in the process and would not meet this SC.

Note

This success criterion is specifically concerned with moving, blinking, scrolling, and auto-updating visual content. For audio content that starts automatically, refer to [1.4.2 Audio Control](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/audio-control).

Moving, blinking, scrolling content that starts automatically because of a general user interaction (such as focusing/hovering over an element, or scrolling the page), rather than as a result of an intentional _activation_ (such as activating a button), and which doesn't provide provide a way to Pause, Stop, or Hide, will fail this Criterion, and potentially [2.3.3 Animation from Interaction](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/animation=from=interaction).

It is important to note that the terms "blinking" and "flashing" can sometimes refer to the same content.

- "Blinking" refers to content that causes a distraction problem. Blinking can be allowed for a short time as long as it stops (or can be stopped)
- "Flashing" refers to content that can trigger a seizure (if it is more than 3 per second and large and bright enough). This cannot be allowed even for a second or it could cause a seizure. And turning the flash off is also not an option since the seizure could occur faster than most users could turn it off.
- Blinking usually does not occur at speeds of 3 per second or more, but it can. If blinking occurs faster than 3 per second, it would also be considered a flash.

Note

"Flashing" content that starts automatically will need to be evaluated against [2.3.2 Three Flashes](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/three-flashes) and [2.3.1 Three Flashes or Below Threshold](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/three-flashes-or-below-threshold).

## Benefits

- Providing content that stops blinking after five seconds or providing a mechanism for users to stop blinking content allows people with certain disabilities to interact with the web page.
- One use of content that blinks is to draw the visitor's attention to that content. Although this is an effective technique for all users with vision, it can be a problem for some users if it persists. For certain groups, including people with low literacy, reading and intellectual disabilities, and people with attention deficit disorders, content that blinks may make it difficult or even impossible to interact with the rest of the web page.

## Examples

An essential animation can be paused without affecting the activity

A website helps users understand 'how things work' through animations that demonstrate processes. Animations have "pause" and "restart" buttons.

A stock ticker

A stock ticker has "pause" and "restart" buttons. Pausing the ticker causes it to pause on the currently displayed stock. Restarting causes the ticker to resume from the stopped point but with a notice that the display is delayed. Since the intent of the stock ticker is usually to provide realtime information, there might also be a button that would advance the ticker to the most recently traded stock.

A game is designed so that users take turns rather than competing in real-time

One party can pause the game without invalidating the competitive aspect of it.

A web advertisement

An advertisement blinks to get viewers attention but stops after 5 seconds

A form prompt

A form blinks an arrow near the submit button if a user finishes filling out the form but does not activate the submit button. The blinking stops after 5 seconds.

An animation

An animation runs in the upper portion of the page but has a "freeze animation" button near the bottom of the animation.

A "loading" animation

A preloader animation is shown on a page which requires a certain percentage of a large file to be downloaded before playback can begin. The animation is the only content on the page and instructs the user to please wait while the video loads. Because the moving content is not presented in parallel with other content, no mechanism to pause, stop or hide it needs to be provided, even though the animation may run for more than 5 seconds for users with slower connections.

A full-page advertisement

A site requires that all users view a 15 second advertisement before they can access free content available from their site. Because viewing the advertisement is a requirement for all users and because it is not presented in parallel with other content, no mechanism to pause, stop or hide it needs to be provided.

## Techniques

Each numbered item in this section represents a technique or combination of techniques that the WCAG Working Group deems sufficient for meeting this Success Criterion. A technique may go beyond the minimum requirement of the criterion. There may be other ways of meeting the criterion not covered by these techniques. For information on using other techniques, see [Understanding Techniques for WCAG Success Criteria](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/understanding-techniques), particularly the "Other Techniques" section.

### Failures

The following are common mistakes that are considered failures of this Success Criterion by the WCAG Working Group.

- [F16: Failure of Success Criterion 2.2.2 due to including scrolling content where movement is not essential to the activity without also including a mechanism to pause and restart the content](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Techniques/failures/F16)
- [F112: Failure of Success Criterion 2.2.2 due to using blinking content that lasts for more than five seconds without a mechanism to stop it](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Techniques/failures/F112)
- [F50: Failure of Success Criterion 2.2.2 due to a script that causes a blink effect without a mechanism to stop the blinking at 5 seconds or less](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Techniques/failures/F50)
- [F7: Failure of Success Criterion 2.2.2 due to an object or applet … for more than five seconds](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Techniques/failures/F7)

## Key Terms

assistive technology

hardware and/or software that acts as a [user agent](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/#dfn-user-agent), or along with a mainstream user agent, to provide functionality to meet the requirements of users with disabilities that go beyond those offered by mainstream user agents

Note 1

Functionality provided by assistive technology includes alternative presentations (e.g., as synthesized speech or magnified content), alternative input methods (e.g., voice), additional navigation or orientation mechanisms, and content transformations (e.g., to make tables more accessible).

Note 2

Assistive technologies often communicate data and messages with mainstream user agents by using and monitoring APIs.

Note 3

The distinction between mainstream user agents and assistive technologies is not absolute. Many mainstream user agents provide some features to assist individuals with disabilities. The basic difference is that mainstream user agents target broad and diverse audiences that usually include people with and without disabilities. Assistive technologies target narrowly defined populations of users with specific disabilities. The assistance provided by an assistive technology is more specific and appropriate to the needs of its target users. The mainstream user agent may provide important functionality to assistive technologies like retrieving web content from program objects or parsing markup into identifiable bundles.

blinking

switch back and forth between two visual states in a way that is meant to draw attention

Note

See also [flash](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/#dfn-flash). It is possible for something to be large enough and blink brightly enough at the right frequency to be also classified as a flash.

conformance

satisfying all the requirements of a given standard, guideline or specification

essential

if removed, would fundamentally change the information or functionality of the content, **and** information and functionality cannot be achieved in another way that would conform

flash

a pair of opposing changes in [relative luminance](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/#dfn-relative-luminance) that can cause seizures in some people if it is large enough and in the right frequency range

Note 1

See [general flash and red flash thresholds](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/#dfn-general-flash-and-red-flash-thresholds) for information about types of flash that are not allowed.

Note 2

See also [blinking](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/#dfn-blinking).

general flash and red flash thresholds

a [flash](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/#dfn-flash) or rapidly changing image sequence is below the threshold (i.e., content **passes**) if any of the following are true:

- there are no more than three **general flashes** and / or no more than three **red flashes** within any one-second period; or
- the combined area of flashes occurring concurrently occupies no more than a total of.006 steradians within any 10 degree visual field on the screen (25% of any 10 degree visual field on the screen) at typical viewing distance

where:

- A **general flash** is defined as a pair of opposing changes in [relative luminance](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/#dfn-relative-luminance) of 10% or more of the maximum relative luminance (1.0) where the relative luminance of the darker image is below 0.80; and where "a pair of opposing changes" is an increase followed by a decrease, or a decrease followed by an increase, and
- A **red flash** is defined as any pair of opposing transitions involving a saturated red

_Exception:_ Flashing that is a fine, balanced, pattern such as white noise or an alternating checkerboard pattern with "squares" smaller than 0.1 degree (of visual field at typical viewing distance) on a side does not violate the thresholds.

Note 1

For general software or web content, using a 341 x 256 pixel rectangle anywhere on the displayed screen area when the content is viewed at 1024 x 768 pixels will provide a good estimate of a 10 degree visual field for standard screen sizes and viewing distances (e.g., 15-17 inch screen at 22-26 inches). This resolution of 75 - 85 ppi is known to be lower, and thus more conservative than the nominal CSS pixel resolution of 96 ppi in CSS specifications. Higher resolutions displays showing the same rendering of the content yield smaller and safer images so it is lower resolutions that are used to define the thresholds.

Note 2

A transition is the change in relative luminance (or relative luminance/color for red flashing) between adjacent peaks and valleys in a plot of relative luminance (or relative luminance/color for red flashing) measurement against time. A flash consists of two opposing transitions.

Note 3

The new working definition in the field for **"pair of opposing transitions involving a saturated red"** (from WCAG 2.2) is a pair of opposing transitions where, one transition is either to or from a state with a value R/(R + G + B) that is greater than or equal to 0.8, and the difference between states is more than 0.2 (unitless) in the CIE 1976 UCS chromaticity diagram. \[[ISO_9241-391](https://www.iso.org/standard/56350.html)\]

Note 4

Tools are available that will carry out analysis from video screen capture. However, no tool is necessary to evaluate for this condition if flashing is less than or equal to 3 flashes in any one second. Content automatically passes (see #1 and #2 above).

mechanism

[process](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/#dfn-process) or technique for achieving a result

Note 1

The mechanism may be explicitly provided in the content, or may be [relied upon](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/#dfn-relied-upon) to be provided by either the platform or by [user agents](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/#dfn-user-agent), including [assistive technologies](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/#dfn-assistive-technology).

Note 2

The mechanism needs to meet all success criteria for the conformance level claimed.

paused

stopped by user request and not resumed until requested by user

process

series of user actions where each action is required in order to complete an activity

relative luminance

the relative brightness of any point in a colorspace, normalized to 0 for darkest black and 1 for lightest white

Note 1

For the sRGB colorspace, the relative luminance of a color is defined as L = 0.2126 \* **R** + 0.7152 \* **G** + 0.0722 \* **B** where **R**, **G** and **B** are defined as:

- if RsRGB <= 0.04045 then **R** = RsRGB/12.92 else **R** = ((RsRGB+0.055)/1.055) ^ 2.4
- if GsRGB <= 0.04045 then **G** = GsRGB/12.92 else **G** = ((GsRGB+0.055)/1.055) ^ 2.4
- if BsRGB <= 0.04045 then **B** = BsRGB/12.92 else **B** = ((BsRGB+0.055)/1.055) ^ 2.4

and RsRGB, GsRGB, and BsRGB are defined as:

- RsRGB = R8bit/255
- GsRGB = G8bit/255
- BsRGB = B8bit/255

The "^" character is the exponentiation operator. (Formula taken from \[[SRGB](https://webstore.iec.ch/publication/6169)\].)

Note 2

Before May 2021 the value of 0.04045 in the definition was different (0.03928). It was taken from an older version of the specification and has been updated. It has no practical effect on the calculations in the context of these guidelines.

Note 3

Almost all systems used today to view web content assume sRGB encoding. Unless it is known that another color space will be used to process and display the content, authors should evaluate using sRGB colorspace. If using other color spaces, see [Understanding Success Criterion 1.4.3](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/contrast-minimum).

Note 4

If dithering occurs after delivery, then the source color value is used. For colors that are dithered at the source, the average values of the colors that are dithered should be used (average R, average G, and average B).

Note 5

Tools are available that automatically do the calculations when testing contrast and flash.

Note 6

A [separate page giving the relative luminance definition using MathML](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/relative-luminance.html) to display the formulas is available.

relied upon

the content would not [conform](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/#dfn-conformance) if that [technology](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/#dfn-technology) is turned off or is not supported

Note 1

As used in these guidelines "web technology" and the word "technology" (when used alone) both refer to web content technologies.

Note 2

Web content technologies may include markup languages, data formats, or programming languages that authors may use alone or in combination to create end-user experiences that range from static web pages to synchronized media presentations to dynamic Web applications.

## Test Rules

The following are Test Rules for certain aspects of this Success Criterion. It is not necessary to use these particular Test Rules to check for conformance with WCAG, but they are defined and approved test methods.
