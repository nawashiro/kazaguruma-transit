## Understanding: Language of Page (Level A)

## In Brief

Goal

Assistive technology can determine the language of a page.

What to do

Indicate the predominant language on a page.

Why it's important

People using assistive technology get information in the correct language.

## Success Criterion (SC)

The default [human language](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/#dfn-human-language) of each [web page](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/#dfn-web-page) can be [programmatically determined](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/#dfn-programmatically-determined).

## Intent

The intent of this success criterion is to ensure that content developers provide information in the web page that user agents need to present text and other linguistic content correctly. Both assistive technologies and conventional user agents can render text more accurately when the language of the web page is identified. Screen readers can load the correct pronunciation rules. Visual browsers can display characters and scripts correctly. Media players can show captions correctly. As a result, users with disabilities will be better able to understand the content.

The default human language of the web page is the default text-processing language as discussed in . When a web page uses several languages, the default text-processing language is the language which is used most. (If several languages are used equally, the first language used should be chosen as the default human language.)

Note

For multilingual sites targeting Conformance Level A, the Working Group strongly encourages developers to follow Success Criterion 3.1.2 as well even though that is a Level AA success criterion.

## Benefits

This success criterion helps:

- people who use screen readers or other technologies that convert text into synthetic speech;
- people who find it difficult to read written material with fluency and accuracy, such as recognizing characters and alphabets or decoding words;
- people with certain cognitive, language and learning disabilities who use text-to-speech software
- people who rely on captions for synchronized media.

## Examples

Example 1. A web page with content in two languages

A web page produced in Germany and written in HTML includes content in both German and English, but most of the content is in German. The default human language is identified as German (de) by the lang attribute on the html element.

## Techniques

Each numbered item in this section represents a technique or combination of techniques that the WCAG Working Group deems sufficient for meeting this Success Criterion. A technique may go beyond the minimum requirement of the criterion. There may be other ways of meeting the criterion not covered by these techniques. For information on using other techniques, see [Understanding Techniques for WCAG Success Criteria](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/understanding-techniques), particularly the "Other Techniques" section.

### Sufficient Techniques

- [H57: Using the language attribute on the HTML element](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Techniques/html/H57)
- [PDF16: Setting the default language using the /Lang entry in the document catalog of a PDF document](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Techniques/pdf/PDF16)
- [PDF19: Specifying the language for a passage or phrase with the Lang entry in PDF documents](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Techniques/pdf/PDF19)

### Advisory Techniques

Although not required for conformance, the following additional techniques should be considered in order to make content more accessible. Not all techniques can be used or would be effective in all situations.

## Key Terms

assistive technology

hardware and/or software that acts as a [user agent](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/#dfn-user-agent), or along with a mainstream user agent, to provide functionality to meet the requirements of users with disabilities that go beyond those offered by mainstream user agents

Note 1

Functionality provided by assistive technology includes alternative presentations (e.g., as synthesized speech or magnified content), alternative input methods (e.g., voice), additional navigation or orientation mechanisms, and content transformations (e.g., to make tables more accessible).

Note 2

Assistive technologies often communicate data and messages with mainstream user agents by using and monitoring APIs.

Note 3

The distinction between mainstream user agents and assistive technologies is not absolute. Many mainstream user agents provide some features to assist individuals with disabilities. The basic difference is that mainstream user agents target broad and diverse audiences that usually include people with and without disabilities. Assistive technologies target narrowly defined populations of users with specific disabilities. The assistance provided by an assistive technology is more specific and appropriate to the needs of its target users. The mainstream user agent may provide important functionality to assistive technologies like retrieving web content from program objects or parsing markup into identifiable bundles.

human language

language that is spoken, written or signed (through visual or tactile means) to communicate with humans

Note

See also [sign language](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/#dfn-sign-language).

programmatically determined

determined by software from author-supplied data provided in a way that different [user agents](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/#dfn-user-agent), including [assistive technologies](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/#dfn-assistive-technology), can extract and present this information to users in different modalities

sign language

a language using combinations of movements of the hands and arms, facial expressions, or body positions to convey meaning

user agent

any software that retrieves and presents web content for users

web page

a non-embedded resource obtained from a single URI using HTTP plus any other resources that are used in the rendering or intended to be rendered together with it by a [user agent](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/#dfn-user-agent)

Note 1

Although any "other resources" would be rendered together with the primary resource, they would not necessarily be rendered simultaneously with each other.

Note 2

For the purposes of conformance with these guidelines, a resource must be "non-embedded" within the scope of conformance to be considered a web page.

## Test Rules

The following are Test Rules for certain aspects of this Success Criterion. It is not necessary to use these particular Test Rules to check for conformance with WCAG, but they are defined and approved test methods. For information on using Test Rules, see [Understanding Test Rules for WCAG Success Criteria](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/understanding-act-rules.html).

- [HTML page has lang attribute](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/act/rules/b5c3f8/)
- [HTML page lang attribute has valid language tag](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/act/rules/bf051a/)
- [HTML page lang and xml:lang attributes have matching values](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/act/rules/5b7ae0/proposed/)
- [HTML page language subtag matches default language](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/act/rules/ucwvc8/proposed/)
