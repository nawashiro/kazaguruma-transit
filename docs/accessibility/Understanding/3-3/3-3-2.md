## Understanding: Labels or Instructions (Level A)

## In Brief

Goal

Users know what information to enter.

What to do

Provide labels or instructions for inputs.

Why it's important

Everyone, especially those with cognitive disabilities, will know how to respond.

## Success Criterion (SC)

[Labels](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/#dfn-label) or instructions are provided when content requires user input.

## Intent

The intent of this success criterion is to have content authors present instructions or labels that identify the controls in a form so that users know what input data is expected. In the case of radio buttons, checkboxes, comboboxes, or similar controls that provide users with options, each option must have an appropriate label so that users know what they are actually selecting. Instructions or labels may also specify data formats for data entry fields, especially if they are out of the customary formats or if there are specific rules for correct input. Content authors may also choose to make such instructions available to users only when the individual control has focus especially when instructions are long and verbose.

The intent of this success criterion is not to clutter the page with unnecessary information but to provide important cues and instructions that will benefit people with disabilities. Too much information or instruction can be just as harmful as too little. The goal is to make certain that enough information is provided for the user to accomplish the task without undue confusion or navigation.

This success criterion does not require that labels or instructions be correctly marked up, identified, or associated with their respective controls — that aspect is covered separately by [1.3.1: Info and Relationships](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/info-and-relationships). It is possible for content to pass this success criterion (providing relevant labels and instructions) while failing Success Criterion 1.3.1 (if the labels or instructions aren't correctly marked up, identified, or associated).

Further, this success criterion does not take into consideration whether or not alternative methods of providing an accessible name or description for form controls and inputs has been used — that aspect is covered separately by [4.1.2: Name, Role and Value](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/name-role-value). It is possible for controls and inputs to have an appropriate accessible name or description (e.g. using `aria-label="..."`) and therefore pass Success Criterion 4.1.2, but to still fail this success criterion (if the labels or instructions aren't presented to all users, not just those using assistive technologies).

This success criterion does not apply to links or other controls (such as an expand/collapse widget, or similar interactive components) that are not associated with data entry.

While this success criterion requires that controls and inputs have labels or instructions, whether or not labels (if used) are accurate, sufficiently clear, or descriptive is covered separately by [2.4.6: Headings and Labels](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/headings-and-labels).

## Examples

- A field which requires the user to enter the two character abbreviation for a US state has a link next to it which will popup an alphabetized list of state names and the correct abbreviation.
- A field for entering a date has text instructions to indicate the correct format for the date.
- On one website, a field with the text label of "username" is provided for someone to create a username to login to a website. On another website, there are strict rules about what characters can be used to create a username. On this website additional instructions would need to accompany the field to prevent users from encountering unnecessary errors.
- A website provides a global search field in the header of the site. Any term can be entered, so there are no instructions needed, but the field needs a cue to communicate its purpose. Commonly, such search field will be paired with a "loupe" or "magnify glass" search icon, serving as its visible label, if not also doubling as the visual identifier for the button that submits the search query.
- To enter their name, users are provided with two separate text fields. Rather than having a single label "Name" (which would appear to leave the second text field unlabelled), each field is given an explicit label — "Given Name" and "Family Name".
- A U.S. phone number separates the area code, exchange, and number into three fields. Parentheses surround the area code field, and a dash separates the exchange and number fields. While the punctuation provides visual clues to those familiar with the U.S. telephone number format, the punctuation is not sufficient to label the fields. The single "Phone number" label also cannot label all three fields. To address this, the three fields are grouped in a fieldset with the legend "Phone number". Visual labels for the fields (beyond the punctuation) cannot be provided in the design, so invisible labels are provided with the "title" attribute to each of the three fields. The value of this attribute for the three fields are, respectively, "Area Code", "Exchange", and "Number".

## Techniques

Each numbered item in this section represents a technique or combination of techniques that the WCAG Working Group deems sufficient for meeting this Success Criterion. A technique may go beyond the minimum requirement of the criterion. There may be other ways of meeting the criterion not covered by these techniques. For information on using other techniques, see [Understanding Techniques for WCAG Success Criteria](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/understanding-techniques), particularly the "Other Techniques" section.

Note

The techniques at the end of the above list should be considered "last resort" and only used when the other techniques cannot be applied to the page. The earlier techniques are preferred because they increase accessibility to a wider user group.

### Advisory Techniques

Although not required for conformance, the following additional techniques should be considered in order to make content more accessible. Not all techniques can be used or would be effective in all situations.

- [G13: Describing what will happen before a change to a form control that causes a change of context to occur is made](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Techniques/general/G13)

### Failures

The following are common mistakes that are considered failures of this Success Criterion by the WCAG Working Group.

- [F82: Failure of Success Criterion 3.3.2 by visually formatting a set of phone number fields but not including a text label](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Techniques/failures/F82)

## Key Terms

ASCII art

picture created by a spatial arrangement of characters or glyphs (typically from the 95 printable characters defined by ASCII)

assistive technology

hardware and/or software that acts as a [user agent](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/#dfn-user-agent), or along with a mainstream user agent, to provide functionality to meet the requirements of users with disabilities that go beyond those offered by mainstream user agents

Note 1

Functionality provided by assistive technology includes alternative presentations (e.g., as synthesized speech or magnified content), alternative input methods (e.g., voice), additional navigation or orientation mechanisms, and content transformations (e.g., to make tables more accessible).

Note 2

Assistive technologies often communicate data and messages with mainstream user agents by using and monitoring APIs.

Note 3

The distinction between mainstream user agents and assistive technologies is not absolute. Many mainstream user agents provide some features to assist individuals with disabilities. The basic difference is that mainstream user agents target broad and diverse audiences that usually include people with and without disabilities. Assistive technologies target narrowly defined populations of users with specific disabilities. The assistance provided by an assistive technology is more specific and appropriate to the needs of its target users. The mainstream user agent may provide important functionality to assistive technologies like retrieving web content from program objects or parsing markup into identifiable bundles.

content

information and sensory experience to be communicated to the user by means of a [user agent](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/#dfn-user-agent), including code or markup that defines the content's [structure](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/#dfn-structure), [presentation](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/#dfn-presentation), and interactions

Note 1

A label is presented to all users whereas the [name](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/#dfn-name) may be hidden and only exposed by assistive technology. In many (but not all) cases the name and the label are the same.

Note 2

The term label is not limited to the label element in HTML.

name

text alternative

[Text](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/#dfn-text) that is programmatically associated with [non-text content](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/#dfn-non-text-content) or referred to from text that is programmatically associated with non-text content. Programmatically associated text is text whose location can be [programmatically determined](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/#dfn-programmatically-determined) from the non-text content.

Note

Refer to [Understanding Text Alternatives](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/conformance#text-alternatives) for more information.

user agent

web page

a non-embedded resource obtained from a single URI using HTTP plus any other resources that are used in the rendering or intended to be rendered together with it by a [user agent](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/#dfn-user-agent)

Note 1

Although any "other resources" would be rendered together with the primary resource, they would not necessarily be rendered simultaneously with each other.

Note 2

For the purposes of conformance with these guidelines, a resource must be "non-embedded" within the scope of conformance to be considered a web page.
