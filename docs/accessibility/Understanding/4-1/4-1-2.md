## Understanding: Name, Role, Value (Level A)

## In Brief

Goal

People using assistive technology understand all components.

What to do

Give components correct names, roles, states, and values.

Why it's important

Assistive technology only works well when code is done properly.

## Success Criterion (SC)

For all [user interface components](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/#dfn-user-interface-component) (including but not limited to: form elements, links and components generated by scripts), the [name](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/#dfn-name) and [role](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/#dfn-role) can be [programmatically determined](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/#dfn-programmatically-determined); [states](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/#dfn-state), properties, and values that can be set by the user can be [programmatically set](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/#dfn-programmatically-set); and notification of changes to these items is available to [user agents](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/#dfn-user-agent), including [assistive technologies](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/#dfn-assistive-technology).

Note

This success criterion is primarily for web authors who develop or script their own user interface components. For example, standard HTML controls already meet this success criterion when used according to specification.

## Intent

The intent of this success criterion is to ensure that Assistive Technologies (AT) can gather appropriate information about, activate (or set) and keep up to date on the status of user interface controls in the content.

When standard controls from accessible technologies are used, this process is straightforward. If the user interface elements are used according to specification the conditions of this provision will be met. (See examples of Success Criterion 4.1.2 below)

If custom controls are created, however, or interface elements are programmed (in code or script) to have a different role and/or function than usual, then additional measures need to be taken to ensure that the controls provide important and appropriate information to assistive technologies and allow themselves to be controlled by assistive technologies.

What roles and states are appropriate to convey to assistive technology will depend on what the control represents. Specifics about such information are defined by other specifications, such as [WAI-ARIA](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/), or the relevant platform standards. Another factor to consider is whether there is sufficient [accessibility support](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/#dfn-accessibility-supported) with assistive technologies to convey the information as specified.

A particularly important state of a user interface control is whether or not it has focus. The focus state of a control can be programmatically determined, and notifications about change of focus are sent to user agents and assistive technology. Other examples of user interface control states are whether or not a checkbox or radio button has been selected, or whether a collapsible tree view or accordion is expanded or collapsed.

Note

Success Criterion 4.1.2 requires a programmatically determinable name for all user interface components. Names may be visible or invisible. Occasionally, the name needs to be visible, in which case it is identified as a label. Refer to the definition of name and label in the glossary for more information.

## Benefits

- Providing role, state, and value information on all user interface components enables compatibility with assistive technology, such as screen readers, screen magnifiers, and speech recognition software, used by people with disabilities.

## Examples

Accessible APIs

A Java applet uses the accessibility API defined by the language.

## Techniques

Each numbered item in this section represents a technique or combination of techniques that the WCAG Working Group deems sufficient for meeting this Success Criterion. A technique may go beyond the minimum requirement of the criterion. There may be other ways of meeting the criterion not covered by these techniques.

## Key Terms

accessibility supported

supported by users' [assistive technologies](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/#dfn-assistive-technology) as well as the accessibility features in browsers and other [user agents](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/#dfn-user-agent)

To qualify as an accessibility-supported use of a web content technology (or feature of a technology), both 1 and 2 must be satisfied for a web content technology (or feature):

1. **The way that the [web content technology](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/#dfn-technology) is used must be supported by users' assistive technology (AT).** This means that the way that the technology is used has been tested for interoperability with users' assistive technology in the [human language(s)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/#dfn-human-language) of the content,
   **AND**
2. **The web content technology must have accessibility-supported user agents that are available to users.** This means that at least one of the following four statements is true:
   1. The technology is supported natively in widely-distributed user agents that are also accessibility supported (such as HTML and CSS);
      **OR**
   2. The technology is supported in a widely-distributed plug-in that is also accessibility supported;
      **OR**
   3. The content is available in a closed environment, such as a university or corporate network, where the user agent required by the technology and used by the organization is also accessibility supported;
      **OR**
   4. The user agent(s) that support the technology are accessibility supported and are available for download or purchase in a way that:
      - does not cost a person with a disability any more than a person without a disability **and**
      - is as easy to find and obtain for a person with a disability as it is for a person without disabilities.

Note 1

The Accessibility Guidelines Working Group and the W3C do not specify which or how much support by assistive technologies there must be for a particular use of a web technology in order for it to be classified as accessibility supported. (See [Level of Assistive Technology Support Needed for "Accessibility Support"](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/conformance#support-level).)

Note 2

Web technologies can be used in ways that are not accessibility supported as long as they are not [relied upon](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/#dfn-relied-upon) and the page as a whole meets the conformance requirements, including [Conformance Requirement 4](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#cc4) and [Conformance Requirement 5](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#cc5).

Note 3

When a [web technology](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/#dfn-technology) is used in a way that is "accessibility supported," it does not imply that the entire technology or all uses of the technology are supported. Most technologies, including HTML, lack support for at least one feature or use. Pages conform to WCAG only if the uses of the technology that are accessibility supported can be relied upon to meet WCAG requirements.

Note 4

When citing web content technologies that have multiple versions, the version(s) supported should be specified.

Note 5

One way for authors to locate uses of a technology that are accessibility supported would be to consult compilations of uses that are documented to be accessibility supported. (See [Understanding Accessibility-Supported Web Technology Uses](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/conformance#documented-lists).) Authors, companies, technology vendors, or others may document accessibility-supported ways of using web content technologies. However, all ways of using technologies in the documentation would need to meet the definition of accessibility-supported Web content technologies above.

ASCII art

picture created by a spatial arrangement of characters or glyphs (typically from the 95 printable characters defined by ASCII)

assistive technology

hardware and/or software that acts as a [user agent](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/#dfn-user-agent), or along with a mainstream user agent, to provide functionality to meet the requirements of users with disabilities that go beyond those offered by mainstream user agents

Note 1

Functionality provided by assistive technology includes alternative presentations (e.g., as synthesized speech or magnified content), alternative input methods (e.g., voice), additional navigation or orientation mechanisms, and content transformations (e.g., to make tables more accessible).

Note 2

Assistive technologies often communicate data and messages with mainstream user agents by using and monitoring APIs.

Note 3

The distinction between mainstream user agents and assistive technologies is not absolute. Many mainstream user agents provide some features to assist individuals with disabilities. The basic difference is that mainstream user agents target broad and diverse audiences that usually include people with and without disabilities. Assistive technologies target narrowly defined populations of users with specific disabilities. The assistance provided by an assistive technology is more specific and appropriate to the needs of its target users. The mainstream user agent may provide important functionality to assistive technologies like retrieving web content from program objects or parsing markup into identifiable bundles.

Note 1

A label is presented to all users whereas the [name](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/#dfn-name) may be hidden and only exposed by assistive technology. In many (but not all) cases the name and the label are the same.

Note 2

The term label is not limited to the label element in HTML.

mechanism

Programmatically associated text is text whose location can be [programmatically determined](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/#dfn-programmatically-determined) from the non-text content.

Note

Refer to [Understanding Text Alternatives](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/conformance#text-alternatives) for more information.

user agent

any software that retrieves and presents web content for users

user interface component

a part of the content that is perceived by users as a single control for a distinct function

Note 1

Multiple user interface components may be implemented as a single programmatic element. "Components" here is not tied to programming techniques, but rather to what the user perceives as separate controls.

Note 2

User interface components include form elements and links as well as components generated by scripts.

Note 3

What is meant by "component" or "user interface component" here is also sometimes called "user interface element".

web page

a non-embedded resource obtained from a single URI using HTTP plus any other resources that are used in the rendering or intended to be rendered together with it by a [user agent](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/#dfn-user-agent)

Note 1

Although any "other resources" would be rendered together with the primary resource, they would not necessarily be rendered simultaneously with each other.

Note 2

For the purposes of conformance with these guidelines, a resource must be "non-embedded" within the scope of conformance to be considered a web page.
